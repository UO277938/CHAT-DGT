# CHAT-DGT
My own discord bot, it only runs for a text channel. 
It uses the OpenAI API, planning to use more AI.
In search for new APIs to expand the uses of the bot.

## Features:
 - Reply to a message automaticaly using AI.
 - Create a image from a message using AI.
 - Currently is able to process commands from Discord as /ping... 

## What's next?
 - Better pictures generation using LeonardoAI, waiting for API Key.
 - Music provider, most likely using Youtube.
 - Weather.
 - Games...

I'm still a student, glad you like it. ðŸ˜Š
