# CHAT-DGT
My own discord bot, it only runs for a text channel.

It uses the OpenAI API to create automatic responses and it also can make photos from a text.

Currently is able to process commands from Discord. Searching new API to create a new and fun bot that can create some value even though I'm still learning.
